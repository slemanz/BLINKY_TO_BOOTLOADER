# Blinky to Bootloader

Welcome to the **Blinky to Bootloader** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring the STM32F401 microcontroller from the basics all the way to a fully functional bootloader that includes an update mechanism. We focus on bare metal programming without the use of any IDE, allowing you to gain a deeper understanding of embedded systems.
